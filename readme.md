# Validator as a Service
## Project Description
When delegating your stake to a pool there is a certain amount of trust needed: a malicious pool could keep your profits or could not pay you the amount you deserve. For a novice this is impossible to notice.

Additionally, when staking, a fee of 5% (estimated pool fee) seems small but when owning larger amounts of NIM the fees will be a substantial amount of money.

Due to their simplicity, pools tend to grow and accumulate a large share of the market (see PoW Pools in 1.0). In terms of stability and decentralization this poses another problem.

The goal of this project is to solve these problems by enabling non-technical people to run a validator for themselves so they do not have to rely on a pool. Basically, the idea is to offer “Validators as a Service”.

Our proposal is to offer a service that requires very low trust for both parties. We will never be in control of the user’s money or even the money that is earned while staking (in contrast to a staking pool).

Instead of taking a cut of the rewards we plan to take a fixed fee for operating the validator nodes. This means for the user that our service is financially beneficial for the user once an amount of ~$35k is staked (in comparison to the average pool fees; based on $10 Validator, 7% Reward, 5% Pool Fee).

Having more independent validators, rather than big pools, will also help with decentralization and secure the network.
